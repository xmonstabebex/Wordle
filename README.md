"Wordle is a daily word game created by Josh Wardle, a Brooklyn-based software engineer who has developed something of a reputation as a crafter of interesting social experiments.
Every day, the people of the internet are greeted with a fresh word puzzle that can only be solved — or not! — using a series of process-of-elimination clues."
Last summer, my friends and I decided to code our own version of Wordle. While it is a simple game on the surface, there is a lot going on behind the scenes.
The front-end part was enjoyable to create, and for fun and to learn something new, I decided to add a day and night mode.
During this period, I made numerous design decisions, such as choosing fonts, creating a logo, and implementing animations. Overall, it was a fun experience

ps. the keyboard in the site does not work. you have to use your physical keyboard.
